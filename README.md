# NeteaseMusic
This script is for python self-learning purposes ONLY.
The goal of the script is to demo how to manipulate binary files and iteration json files.
Save Netease music cache to audio files.
Take your own risk while you use the script.

There is a bug in Netease windows player. It will not refresh playlist_history file. A potential workaround is to delete webapp, webdata, and other temp files. After re-login in, the playlist_history will be automatically refreshed.
